        Hi! I'm Abheet and as you might have read above I am a web developer who
        likes to try his hands on new and upcoming technology. I have also begun
        to venture into the vast field of Machine Learning and Data Science to
        get a feel of the technology that has magnetised the world. I currently
        am in the final year of my engineering in IT at Dwarkadas J. Sanghvi
        College of Engineering. I have developed the above-mentioned projects
        using a myriad of technologies ranging from React.js, Node.js to Django,
        etc.
